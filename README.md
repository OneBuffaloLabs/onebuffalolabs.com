Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **onebuffalolabs.com**\! This is where we herd the code that powers our digital home base.

## Forged in Buffalo, Built for the Future

At One Buffalo Labs, we're more than just a tech agency; we're a herd of passionate developers, designers, and innovators deeply rooted in the heart of Buffalo, NY. We were born from a love for our city and a passion for technology, and we're on a mission to power Buffalo's digital future. This repository contains the code that showcases our commitment to that mission.

## What's Inside?

This repo is the engine behind our main website. Here's a peek at what makes it tick:

  * **Next.js & React**: We use this powerful duo to build a lightning-fast and modern web experience.
  * **TypeScript**: To keep our code clean, scalable, and sturdy.
  * **Tailwind CSS**: For crafting a beautiful, responsive design that looks great on any device.
  * **GitHub Pages**: We use GitHub Pages for robust and seamless deployment, directly from our repository.

While our client portfolio is still growing, this site is a living testament to our capabilities and our dedication to quality and innovation.

## Our Guiding Principles

Everything we build is guided by our core values:

  * **Innovation**: We're always pushing the boundaries of technology to deliver creative and effective solutions.
  * **Community**: We are deeply committed to fostering local growth and collaboration here in Buffalo.
  * **Quality**: We uphold the highest standards in every line of code and every pixel we design.
  * **Client-Centric**: Your success is our ultimate goal. We're here to build partnerships, not just projects.

## Explore Our Labs

Beyond our client work, we're always experimenting with new ideas and contributing to the open-source community. Be sure to check out our [Labs & Open Source Initiatives](https://www.onebuffalolabs.com/labs) to see what we're cooking up\!
