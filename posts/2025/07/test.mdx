This is the first blog post on our new site! It's written in MDX, which lets us mix Markdown with React components.

## Markdown Features

We can use all the standard Markdown features, like:

- Lists
- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- [Links](https://onebuffalolabs.com)

## Code Highlighting

Because we configured `rehype-highlight`, we get beautiful syntax highlighting for our code blocks automatically.

```javascript
// This is a javascript code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('Developer');
```

This makes it easy to share code snippets and tutorials.
