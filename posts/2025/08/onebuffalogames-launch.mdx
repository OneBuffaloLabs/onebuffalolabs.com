Press start, everyone! After countless hours of coding, pixel-pushing, and chugging way too much tea, we're thrilled to officially launch our latest project: **[One Buffalo Games](https://onebuffalogames.com)**!

This isn't just another website for us; it's a passion project. Born from a love for classic arcades and a drive to build cool stuff for the web, One Buffalo Games is our new home for everything gaming.

## So, What's in the Box?

One Buffalo Games is built on three core pillars, giving you a trifecta of gaming goodness:

1.  **Game Hubs:** A curated collection of our deep-dive resource sites for major gaming franchises like **COD RCG** and **Royale Hub**. These are your one-stop shops for stats, tools, and resources.

2.  **Original Games:** This is where we showcase our more substantial, original games built from the ground up. Expect unique, browser-based experiences that we're building from scratch.

3.  **Classic Arcade:** Sometimes you just want that hit of nostalgia. This section is for simple, retro web games that you can play right in your browser for a quick trip down memory lane. No quarters needed!

## The Tech Stack Power-Up

For the tech-savvy folks out there, we wanted to build this platform on a modern, lightning-fast stack. Hereâ€™s a peek under the hood:

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) for its incredible performance and server-side rendering capabilities.
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) all the way. Type safety is non-negotiable for a project of this scale.
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first workflow that allowed us to rapidly build and iterate on the retro-arcade aesthetic.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for robust and straightforward deployment.

Building this site was a blast. We got to play with fun CSS animations for the neon glow effects, create a dynamic filtering system for the games and hubs pages, and structure everything with a component-first mindset.

## Game On!

This is just the beginning for One Buffalo Games. We have a backlog of ideas for new hubs, original games, and classic titles we want to add.

So what are you waiting for? Go check out **[OneBuffaloGames.com](https://onebuffalogames.com)**, play a game or two, and let us know what you think on our socials!

Happy gaming!
