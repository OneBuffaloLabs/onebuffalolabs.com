Hey tech community! We're excited to officially introduce you to **Vitals**, a new SEO analysis tool from **One Buffalo Labs**. We've been hard at work building a tool that's not only powerful but also respects your privacy. In a world where data is everything, we decided to take a different approach: what if you could get a comprehensive SEO audit without sending your data to a server?

That's the core idea behind Vitals. It's a **fast, modern, and client-side analysis tool** built with Next.js and TypeScript that runs entirely in your browser.

### Why Client-Side? ü§î

The "client-side" aspect is what makes Vitals special. It means that when you enter a URL, the analysis happens right there on your machine. We don't collect, store, or track the URLs you analyze, and we don't save the results. This approach offers two huge benefits:

1.  **Privacy**: Your data is yours and yours alone.
2.  **Speed**: By cutting out the back-and-forth with a server, the analysis is incredibly fast.

### Core Features: What's Under the Hood? üõ†Ô∏è

We've packed Vitals with features to give you a comprehensive look at your website's SEO health. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect.

#### On-Page SEO Basics

We cover the fundamentals, including:

- **Title Tags, Meta Descriptions, and H1s**: We analyze these for content and length, giving you clear recommendations based on SEO best practices.
- **Header Hierarchy**: Get a full breakdown of your `H1-H6` tags to ensure your content is structured correctly.
- **Image SEO**: Vitals scans every image and checks for `alt` text, a crucial component for accessibility and SEO.

#### Technical SEO

We also dig into the more technical aspects of your site:

- **File Access**: We check for `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` to make sure search engines can crawl your site effectively.
- **Canonical Tags**: We verify your `rel="canonical"` tags to help you avoid duplicate content issues.
- **HTTP Headers**: We inspect your response headers for security best practices like `Content-Security-Policy` and `Strict-Transport-Security`, as well as content encoding.

#### Branding and Identity

Your brand's presentation is key, so we've included:

- **Favicon Analysis**: We run detailed checks for all modern favicon formats, including `SVG`, `PNG`, and `ICO`.
- **Web App Manifest**: Vitals parses your `manifest.json` file to ensure your Progressive Web App (PWA) is configured correctly with a name, short name, theme color, background color, and the required icon sizes.
- **Social Sharing**: We check for Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags to make sure your content looks great when it's shared on social media.

### What's Next? The Future of Vitals üîÆ

We're just getting started! We're already planning our next set of features, with the big one on the horizon being **Core Web Vitals integration**. Soon, you'll be able to get real-world performance data (LCP, INP, and CLS) right inside Vitals.

### Our Tech Stack ü§ì

For those who love the nitty-gritty, Vitals is built with:

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Parsing**: Cheerio
