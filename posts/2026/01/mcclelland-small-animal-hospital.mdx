How do you modernize a Buffalo institution that has been serving pets since 1880?

That was the challenge—and the honor—when **McClelland Small Animal Hospital** tapped us for a total digital redesign. As Buffalo’s oldest operating animal hospital, they have a legacy that few can match. However, their previous website didn't reflect the high-caliber surgical, dental, and wellness care they provide today.

## Bridging History and Modernity

Our goal was to build a bridge between their historic roots and the modern expectations of today’s pet owners. Clients expect to find service details, vet bios, and contact info instantly, often from a smartphone in the parking lot.

### Our Approach

1. **Mobile-First Accessibility:** We prioritized a "one-tap" experience. Whether a pet owner needs to call for an appointment or find emergency hours, the information is instantly accessible without pinching or zooming.
2. **Streamlined Patient Resources:** We integrated direct access to their **Online Pharmacy**, allowing clients to easily refill prescriptions without navigating a maze of pages.
3. **Service Spotlights:** We built out dedicated sections for their comprehensive services, ensuring pet owners understand the full scope of care available—from wellness exams to complex surgeries.
4. **Buffalo-Centric UX:** Using **Next.js** and **Cloudflare Pages**, we ensured the site is blazing fast for local users, regardless of their connection speed.

## Why Performance Matters for Vets

Just like human healthcare, veterinary websites need to be reliable. When a pet owner is worried about their animal, they want answers fast. By optimizing the site's performance, we reduced friction for clients trying to contact the hospital or find emergency information.

## The Outcome

McClelland now has a digital storefront that matches the quality of care they’ve provided to Western New York for over a century. It’s a perfect blend of Buffalo history and modern digital strategy.
