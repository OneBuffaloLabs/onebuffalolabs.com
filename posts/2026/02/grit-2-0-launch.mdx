When I first built Grit, the mission was simple: create a privacy-first, offline tracker for the 75 Hard challenge. It was a tool built for a very specific, very intense program.

But as I talked to more people—friends, family, and users here in Buffalo—I realized something important. **75 Hard isn’t for everyone, and that shouldn't stop you from building better habits.**

Some people wanted to build a foundation without the risk of injury. Others wanted to focus on consistency rather than intensity. And some of you just wanted to create your own rules entirely.

That’s why I’m thrilled to introduce **Grit 2.0**. We have completely rebuilt the platform to support _your_ journey, no matter where you are starting from.

## More Than Just "Hard"

The biggest change in Grit 2.0 is inclusivity. We realized that "mental toughness" looks different for everyone. If 75 Hard feels like too much right now, that's okay. We’ve added three new ways to challenge yourself:

- **75 Soft:** Perfect for building lasting habits without burning out.
- **75 Balanced:** The sweet spot. Builds consistency with a mix of workouts and reading.
- **Custom:** You are in the driver's seat. Total control over your rules.

We created these modes for people who want to get back into fitness or discipline but need a program that fits their actual life.

_Whether you are building a foundation or testing your limits, there is now a path for you._

## Deep Customization (The "2.0" Update)

We didn't just add new modes; we gave you the keys to the car. In the past, the app forced you to track everything. Now, you can toggle features on or off to match your goals.

- **Don't want to step on the scale?** Turn off Weight Tracking.
- **Want to focus on inches lost?** Enable the new Body Measurements to track your chest, waist, hips, and biceps.
- **Need to quit a bad habit?** Use the new "Name Your Vice" feature to specifically track what you are cutting out (like soda, sugar, or social media).

## Celebrating Your Transformation

Finishing a challenge is a massive deal. It takes true grit to show up for 75 days straight. We wanted the finish line to feel special.

In Grit 2.0, when you finish a challenge, you don’t just get a "Good Job" message. You get a full **Physical Transformation Report**.

If you tracked your measurements, we calculate exactly how many inches you lost (or gained) in every spot. We also calculate the total gallons of water you drank, the pages you read, and—if you were brave enough to face the Buffalo winter—we even award you a badge for your **Outdoor Sessions**.

## My Next Challenge: 75 Balanced

I’m not just the developer; I’m a user. To put Grit 2.0 to the test, **I am officially starting the 75 Balanced challenge today.**

I’ll be using the app to log everything—my workouts, my water, and my reading. I’ll be blogging about the journey right here on One Buffalo Labs. It’s going to be a great way to stay consistent and prove that these tools really work in the wild.

If you’ve been thinking about making a change but were intimidated by 75 Hard, I invite you to join me on **75 Balanced** (or even 75 Soft!).

Let’s get to work.
