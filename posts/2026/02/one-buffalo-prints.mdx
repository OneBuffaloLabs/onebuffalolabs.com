This is another side of One Buffalo Labs. While I enjoy building structured software like [FilaMeter](https://filameter.com/) to manage the _logistics_ of 3D printing, sometimes you just need to print something cool because you can.

That’s why I’m opening up **One Buffalo Prints**.

It’s basically the open-source repository for the things getting churned out of my workshop. It’s not meant to be a perfectly curated product line; it’s a realistic look at what I’m currently building, fixing, or completely obsessed with.

## What You’ll Find Here

The collection is going to be pretty eclectic, reflecting whatever problem I’m trying to solve or whatever catches my eye at 2 a.m. You can generally expect a mix of three things:

- **The Fun Stuff:** Toys, statues, superhero gear, and random props. The exact things we bought 3D printers for in the first place.
- **The Functional Stuff:** Things I need around the house. Brackets, organizers, replacement parts—the boring but incredibly satisfying prints that fix real-world problems.
- **The Printer Stuff:** My current workhorse is a Creality K2 SE. As I use it, I’m inevitably finding things I want to tweak, improve, or fix. If you also run a K2 SE, you’ll probably find these mods useful.

## A Quick Note on My Schedule (Real Talk)

I want to be totally upfront about how this repository works. I work on a lot of different projects simultaneously, balancing both software and hardware.

Because of that, my output here is going to be incredibly bursty. You might see a flurry of five new designs drop in a single weekend because I got into a groove, and then you might not see anything new for a month or two while my focus shifts to [FilaMeter](https://filameter.com/) or another project.

I cannot promise heavy, constant updates. This is strictly a passion project area, not a full-time gig.

## Contributing and Issues

Because my time is sporadic, here is how I'm handling the repository:

- **Use the designs freely!** I hope you enjoy them and get some use out of them.
- **If you find an issue:** Feel free to open a ticket on GitHub. Just know that my response time will vary wildly depending on what else is on my plate. _"Eventually"_ is my guiding principle for bug fixes here.
- **If you can fix it yourself:** Pull Requests are highly encouraged! If you spot a problem with a mesh or have an improvement for a bracket and you have the skills to fix it, send a PR. I’m much faster at reviewing a good model and hitting "merge" than I am at starting a fix from scratch.

Thanks for checking it out, and happy printing!
