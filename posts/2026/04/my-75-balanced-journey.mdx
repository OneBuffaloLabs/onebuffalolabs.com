When I launched **Grit 2.0**, I wanted to prove that discipline doesn't have to be "one size fits all". To put the new customization engine to the test, I officially started my own **75 Balanced** journey on February 5th.

## Why 75 Balanced?

I am a big fan of the 75 Hard concept, but living in **Buffalo, NY**, the "outdoor workout" rule is a dealbreaker in February. Blistering winters make that requirement nearly impossible some days.

I chose the **75 Balanced** path because it focuses on "Sustainable Consistency." It's designed for people like me—parents and business owners who need a program that fits a real 9-to-5 schedule without the high risk of burnout.

## The Challenge Within the Challenge

Beyond the workouts and diet, there is a much bigger factor at play in this journey: **time management**.

I’m currently navigating this challenge while working a full-time software engineering job and simultaneously building my own software company, **One Buffalo Labs**. On top of that professional load, our home life is about to get a lot busier. My wife, Hillary, is due with our second son this March.

Starting this 75-day challenge now means I’ll be balancing the "newborn phase" right alongside my 8-year-old son, Leo. Figuring out how to stay consistent with my workouts and nutrition while dealing with 3 AM feedings and the demands of two separate software ventures will be the ultimate test of the system I built.

## The Rules of the Road

For the next 75 days, my daily checklist looks like this:

- **Diet:** Follow a specific plan with one cheat meal per week.
- **No Alcohol:** I am choosing to cut alcohol completely for the duration of this challenge.
- **Workouts:** One 45-minute workout plus a 15-minute active recovery session (like a stretch or a walk) every day.
- **Water:** Drink 3 Liters (~100 oz) of water daily.
- **Reading:** Read 10 pages of any book.
- **Photos:** Take a progress picture once a week.

### Accountability: The Penalty Day System

One feature I built specifically for the Balanced protocol is the **Penalty Day** system. If you miss a day, you add a day to the end of the challenge instead of restarting at Day 1.

I designed this to provide a **one-shot redemption**—a way to handle a legitimate life emergency without losing all momentum. However, it is a redemption tool, not a failsafe to keep failing and pushing your end date back indefinitely. Interestingly, I found that even with the arrival of our son and the dual-career grind, the system was ultimately unnecessary; the commitment to the routine kept me from ever needing it.

## The Baseline (Day 1)

**Date:** Feb 5, 2026
**Starting Weight:** 278 lbs

While the banner for this post shows my desk setup, the true starting line is the first physical progress photo. I am tracking my weight and body measurements right in the app to see the transformation over the next 10 weeks.

## The Journey Logs

### Phase 1: The Excitement (Days 1-20)

- **High:** The momentum of the launch is keeping me focused.
- **Low:** Hitting that 100oz water goal while in back-to-back meetings is a full-time job.
- **Dev Note:** I’m already looking at the dashboard for ways to make task completion feel even more rewarding.

### Phase 2: The Newborn Grind (Days 21-50)

- **The Factor:** Our son arrived in March! Navigating newborn sleep schedules while maintaining my workload at One Buffalo Labs and my full-time job was intense.
- **Buffalo Factor:** Watching the snow pile up while I do my recovery session inside made me very happy I chose Balanced.

### Phase 3: The Finish Line (Days 51-75)

- **The Shift:** It’s no longer a challenge; it’s just how I live as a husband, father of two, and a business owner.

## Final Thoughts

Building Grit was a challenge. Finishing a 75-day program while welcoming a new child and scaling a company was the ultimate validation. It proves that whether you are doing 75 Hard or 75 Balanced, the most important thing is just showing up for yourself and your family.
