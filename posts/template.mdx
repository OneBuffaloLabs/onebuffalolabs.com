This is where your main article content begins. It supports standard Markdown.

## This is a Subheading

You can structure your content with headings to make it easy to read. You can also use different formatting options:

- Lists are great for summarizing points.
- Use **bold** text to emphasize key terms.
- Use _italic_ text for subtle highlights.
- Add [links](https://onebuffalolabs.com) to internal or external resources.

> Use blockquotes for pull quotes or to highlight important notes from other sources.

## Sharing Code Snippets

For technical posts, sharing code is easy. The code block below will be automatically syntax-highlighted. Make sure to specify the language (e.g., `javascript`, `python`, `tsx`).

```tsx
// This is an example of a React component in TSX.
function MyComponent({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```
